You should have a file in the directory where you are running vep_parser.py and figures_vep.py called params.py.


It should look like this:

params.py

## chrom = chromosome
## datafile = input file name prefix
## ignore_consequence = consequence to ignore. Currently takes only one value
## catalogue = catalogue which gene names are taken from

chrom = '1'
datafile = 'output_'
ignore_consequence = 'downstream_gene_variant'
impact = 'MODIFIER'
catalogue = 'HGNC'
